# Spam Classifier
* In this project I have made a classifier which predicts whether an given email or text input is spam or not.
* I have used dataset for training model from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase this UCI machine learning repository.
* The dataset contains different features and their respective outcomes for being spam or not .
* Build a model by using algorithms namely Random Forest,Support Vector Machine,Naive Bayes.

### Classifiers and their respective accuracy
* Support vector machine classifier = 82.31%
* Naive bayes classifier using Gaussian kernel = 81.52%
* RandomForestClassifier = 93.04%
