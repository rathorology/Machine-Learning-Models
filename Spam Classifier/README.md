In this project I have made a classifier which predicts weather a email or text input is spam or not spam .
I have used dataset for training model from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase this UCI machine learning repository.
The dataset contains different features and their respective outcomes for being spam or not .
I have made a machine learning model by using algorithms namely Random Forest,Support Vector Machine,Naive Bayes.
I have also cross validate the trained model to predict the model acuuracy and generated 93% accuracy by using Random Forest algorithm.
