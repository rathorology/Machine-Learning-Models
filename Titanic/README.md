In this project I have taken dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is of passengers travelling through Titanic and have to predict the survival of passengers on the basis of thier age, gender,fare, Ticket etc .
I took the raw data and used matplotlib feature to visualize the dataset. After visualization of each feature plot the relation of feature with the survival of passenger and performed the data cleaning.
Through feature engeering I arranged data and fill the missing values and remove the useless feature from dataset.
Then apllied the machine learning agorithms and cross validate the dataset and generated model accuracy to 84% maximum.
