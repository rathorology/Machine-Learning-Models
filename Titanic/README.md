# Titanic Survival
*In this project I have taken dataset from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
*The dataset is of passengers travelling through Titanic and have to predict the survival of passengers based on thier age, gender,fare, Ticket etc .
*Used matplotlib to visualize the dataset and plot the relation of each feature with the survival of passenger and performed the data cleaning.
*Filled the missing values and removed the useless features from dataset.
